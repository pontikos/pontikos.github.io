<h1>Home</h1>

<p>
I am the author of <a href="https://phenopolis.github.io">Phenopolis</a> with my friend and colleague <a href="https://github.com/logust79?tab=repositories">Dr Jing Yu</a>.
I currently postdoc at University College London and collaborate with various groups at QMUL, Oxford, Leeds and Manchester.
The general theme is identifying likely causal genetic variants in patients with rare phenotypes.
A lot of my work revolves around Human Phenotype Ontology and next generation sequencing analysis methods, databases and web services.
I also work part-time at Moorfields Eye Hospital as Senior Data Scientist linking and analysing genetic and clinical imaging data.
Since my computer science undergrad, I have a long standing interest in machine learning and improving our quality of life through automation.
