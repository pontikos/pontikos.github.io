<p>
I am the author of <a href="https://phenopolis.github.io">Phenopolis</a> with my friend and colleague <a href="https://github.com/logust79?tab=repositories">Dr Jing Yu</a>.
I currently postdoc at University College London working primarily with <a href='http://plagnol-lab.blogspot.co.uk/'>Dr Vincent Plagnol</a> and <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=AJHAR52">Prof Alison Hardcastle</a> and collaborating with various groups at UCL, QMUL, Oxford, Leeds and Manchester.
The general theme is identifying likely causal genetic variants in patients with rare phenotypes. A lot of my work revolves around Human Phenotype Ontology and next generation sequencing analysis methods, databases and web services.
I'm also heavily involved in the Health Informatics at Moorfields to link genetic and clinical data.  Since my computer science undergrad,
  I have a long standing interest in machine learning and improving our lives through automation.
