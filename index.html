  <li> PI at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioo/">UCL Institute of Ophthalmology</a> (recipient of <a href="https://www.moorfieldseyecharity.org.uk/career-development-awards">Moorfields Eye Charity Career Development Award</a>) </li>
  <li> Senior Data Scientist at the <a href="https://readingcentre.org/teams/clinical_trials//#dr-nikolas-pontikos">Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre</a>  </li>
  <li> Co-founder of <a href="https://phenopolis.co.uk/">Phenopolis Ltd</a>, a health tech startup </li>
</ul>
  
My main research interest is around joint analysis of genetic and clinical imaging data.
This stems from my PhD where I looked at <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Nikolas_Pontikos_PhD_Thesis_2015/1598198">genetic correlation with flow cytometry data in type 1 diabetes</a>.

My current project <a href="https://www.eye2gene.com/">Eye2Gene</a>  aims to assist the molecular diagnosis and improve communication of findings for inherited retinal diseases.

A lot of my work revolves around image analysis, ontologies, next generation sequencing analysis methods, genomics pipelines, databases and web services.

Since my computer science undergrad, I have a long standing interest in machine learning and improving our quality of life through automation.

I believe in open science, citizen science and sharing of know-how and ideas for the betterment of the human condition.
In that spirit I am part of the <a href="www.myeyesite.org"> MyEyeSite </a> project to empower patients with their health data and have donated my genetic information to the <a href="https://www.personalgenomes.org.uk/">Personal Genome Project UK</a>, a citizen science initiative, helping people learn and understand about genetics!
