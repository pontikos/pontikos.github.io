I'm currently a postdoc at University College London working with <a href='http://plagnol-lab.blogspot.co.uk/'>Dr Vincent Plagnol</a> and collaborating with various groups interested in identifying variants in rare clinical phenotypes.
Here is the current list of groups I'm working with:
<ul>
<li>
 Professor Tony Segal, based in the Raynes building, senior PI and clinician interested in neutrophil biology and inflammatory bowel disorder in which neutrophils play a key role.
 He is particularly interested in manifestations of the disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
</li>
<li>
  Professor Alison Hardcastle at the Institute of Ophthalmology.
</li>
</ul>
I did my Phd with <a href='http://chr1swallace.github.io/'>Dr Chris Wallace </a>.
I worked on normalisation and clustering methods applied to flow cytometry datasets.
I have written some software to analyse flow datasets which you can find on github.
I also had the opportunity of working on some genetic data in particular I devised a technique for imputing the copy number of two KIR genes from SNP signals.
You can find my thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2uxQDg1624kX1kxczhVZG0tOUk">here</a>.
